## üß≠ Project Overview

The ToDo List App is a DevOps-powered task management solution designed to exemplify scalable, automated software delivery workflows. Built with Node.js and backed by MongoDB, it allows users to perform full CRUD operations through a responsive web interface.

Deployed on an AWS EC2 instance, the project offers **two deployment strategies**:

- **Docker Compose** with **Watchtower** for simple container orchestration and automatic updates.
- **Kubernetes (MicroK8s)** with **ArgoCD** for a declarative, GitOps-based deployment approach.

It leverages **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration, **Ansible** for provisioning and configuration, and **Docker** for containerization‚Äîforming a complete CI/CD pipeline. Accessible via the EC2 instance‚Äôs public IP, the solution demonstrates real-world automation, health monitoring, and production-readiness in a cloud-native setup.



## üìö Project Phases

The project is structured into four progressive phases, each building upon the previous to form a complete and production-grade DevOps workflow:

### Phase 1: Application Containerization and CI Integration
- Clone the repository and configure environment variables for MongoDB connectivity.
- Containerize the Node.js application using Docker.
- Set up a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions to automatically build and push Docker images to DockerHub.

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Provisioning and Configuration
- Launch a Linux-based virtual machine on AWS EC2.
- Use Ansible from a local control machine to automate the provisioning of essential packages such as Docker, Git, Node.js, and MongoDB on the EC2 instance.

### Phase 3: Docker-Based Deployment and Auto-Update
- Deploy the containerized application using Docker Compose.
- Configure health checks and implement automatic image updates using Watchtower.
- Ensure the application remains highly available and restartable with minimal manual intervention.

### Phase 4: Kubernetes Orchestration and GitOps Deployment
- Replace Docker Compose with a Kubernetes-based deployment using MicroK8s.
- Manage application deployment using GitOps practices through ArgoCD.
- Use secrets, services, deployments, and ingress controllers to simulate real-world production deployments on cloud-native infrastructure.

---

### üçÉ Step 2: Set Up MongoDB Environment

If you don't have MongoDB installed locally, you can use **MongoDB Atlas** ‚Äî a free, cloud-hosted database service.

#### üß≠ MongoDB Atlas Setup Instructions

1. Go to [https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new **project** and then create a **free-tier cluster**.
3. After the cluster is provisioned:
   - Create a **new database user** with a **username and password**.
   - Go to **Network Access** ‚Üí Allow access from anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`).
   - Click **"Connect" ‚Üí "Connect your application"** and copy the connection URI. It will look like this:

     ```
     mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     ```

4. Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your actual credentials.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This URI is private and includes credentials. Do **not** push it to GitHub.

---

#### üìÅ Create Your `.env` File

- In the project root directory, create the environment file:
  ```bash
  touch .env
  ```

- Add the MongoDB connection string and port:
  ```bash
  echo "MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string" >> .env
  echo "PORT=4000" >> .env
  ```

---

#### üõ°Ô∏è Protect Your Secrets

- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` to ensure it‚Äôs not tracked:
  ```bash
  echo ".env" >> .gitignore
  git add .gitignore
  git commit -m "Ignore .env for security"
  git push -u origin main
  ```

- Verify that `.env` is ignored:
  ```bash
  git status
  ```

---

#### ‚úÖ Verify MongoDB Connection

- Run the app locally using Node or Docker:
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm start
  ```

  **OR if you're using Docker:**
  ```bash
  docker build -t todo-app .
  docker run -p 4000:4000 --env-file .env todo-app
  ```

- In your terminal logs, you should see a success message like:
  ```
  Connected to MongoDB...
  Server running on port 4000
  ```

- Visit the app in your browser at:
  ```
  http://localhost:4000/dashboard
  ```

If the dashboard loads and you can add tasks, the app is successfully connected to your MongoDB database.

### üê≥ Step 3: Dockerize the Application

- Create a `Dockerfile` in the root directory (available in the repo).

- Build the Docker image:
  ```bash
  docker build -t todo-app .
  ```

- Run the app container locally:
  ```bash
  docker run -p 4000:4000 todo-app
  ```

- Check running containers:
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

- Commit and push the `Dockerfile`:
  ```bash
  git add Dockerfile
  git commit -m "Add Dockerfile for Dockerization"
  git push -u origin main
  ```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Set Up CI with GitHub Actions

- Create the workflows directory:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p .github/workflows
  ```

- Create a CI workflow file (`ci.yml`) ‚Äì already included in the repository.

- Commit and push the workflow:
  ```bash
  git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
  git commit -m "Add CI pipeline with GitHub Actions"
  git push -u origin main
  ```

- Configure GitHub Actions Secrets:
  - `DOCKER_USERNAME`
  - `DOCKER_PASSWORD`  
  _(Set via GitHub ‚Üí Repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets & Variables ‚Üí Actions)_

- Check the Actions tab on GitHub for a successful workflow run.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Validate Phase Completion

- Rebuild and test the Docker image:
  ```bash
  docker build -t todo-app .
  docker run -p 4000:4000 todo-app
  ```

- Visit [http://localhost:4000/dashboard](http://localhost:4000/dashboard) to confirm the app is running.

- Stop the running container:
  ```bash
  docker stop $(docker ps -q)
  ```

---

üéâ **Phase 1 completed:** The app is now containerized and CI is working with GitHub Actions and Docker Hub.


## üöÄ Phase 2: EC2 Instance Creation and Ansible Configuration

With the application containerized and a CI pipeline in place, we now move on to provisioning a virtual machine on AWS and configuring it using Ansible for remote automation.

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Step 1: Launch AWS EC2 Instance

> **Goal**: Create a cloud-hosted virtual machine that will run our containerized application.

- Log into the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com).
- Navigate to **EC2 > Instances > Launch Instance**.
- Configure the instance:
  - **AMI**: Ubuntu 20.04
  - **Instance Type**: `t3.small` (2 vCPUs, 2 GB RAM)
  - **Key Pair**: Create a new key pair (e.g., `todo-key.pem`)
  - **Security Group**:
    - Allow **SSH (22)** from your IP
    - Allow **TCP (31013)** for the app
    - Allow **TCP (8080)** for ArgoCD

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Save the `.pem` file securely and note your public EC2 IP.

---

### üß± Step 2: Install WSL for Windows (if applicable)

> **Goal**: Enable a Linux environment on Windows for Ansible execution.

```bash
wsl --install
```

Install Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store, then launch it and update the system:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Verify installation:

```bash
wsl -l -v
```

---

### üß∞ Step 3: Install and Configure Ansible

> **Goal**: Use Ansible to remotely install Docker on the EC2 instance.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible -y
```

Check Ansible version:

```bash
ansible --version
```

---

### üîê Step 4: Transfer Your EC2 Key to WSL

Move your `.pem` file to the Linux environment:

```bash
cp /mnt/c/Users/<YourUsername>/Downloads/todo-key.pem ~/
chmod 400 ~/todo-key.pem
```

---

### üîå Step 5: Verify SSH Access to EC2

```bash
ssh -i ~/todo-key.pem ubuntu@<ec2-public-ip>
```

Exit the EC2 shell after confirming access:

```bash
exit
```

---

### üìÇ Step 6: Add Ansible Inventory File

> The inventory file used for defining remote hosts and SSH details can be found in the repository as `inventory`.

Create it like this:

```bash
touch inventory
```

Edit it or copy it from the project repository.

---

### üìù Step 7: Add Ansible Playbook

> The Ansible playbook that installs and starts Docker is included in the repository as `playbook.yml`.

Create it like this:

```bash
touch playbook.yml
```

Edit it or retrieve it from the repo.
